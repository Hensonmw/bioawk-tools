#
# Reads a BED file and computes the number of overlapping sequence 5' ends
# across strands, user may specify a shift for the positions on the + strand
# 
# For a chip-seq experiment this number will be maximized when the shift is 
# equal with the sequenced DNA fragment size. Note that this is just an estimate
# but it is a good start.
#
# usage:
#
# $ awk -f chipfrag.awk data.bed 
#
# or with paramters:
#
# $ awk -v shift=100 -v max=100000 -f chipfrag.awk data.bed
#
# Outputs the shift and number of matching reads
#
#
# The script should run on a BED file that contains mostly locations
# where binding is expected to occur 
#
# A possible run that would test a range of shifts of 20, 25, 30 to 200
# would look like:
#
# $ for i in $(seq 20 5 200); do awk -v shift=$i -f chipfrag.awk long.bed; done
#
# The line with the largest count indicates the most likely fragment size
#
